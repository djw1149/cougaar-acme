This represents the first release of the ACME Scripting library.  This library must be installed 
on all computers that will control Cougaar societies via ACME.  

Linux Requirments:

  Ruby 1.6.8 ( see http://www.ruby-lang.org )
  MySQL Ruby extension ( see http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby )

Windows Requirements:

  Ruby 1.6.8 Installer ( see http://rubyinstaller.sourceforge.net )

Installation:

To install this library change to the bin directory and run the install script-

  cd bin
  ruby install.rb 
  
Important Note: 

This library does not have to be installed to be used.  If you have a directory where 
you unpack the ACME overlay it creates a subdirectory 'csmart' which holds the 
'acme_scripting' directory.  In that top level directory, if you created a Ruby script 
that you wanted to reference these files from, you simply need to include the directory
path in your Ruby library path:

script.rb

  $:.unshift 'csmart/acme_scripting/src/lib'
  $:.unshift 'csmart/acme_service/src/redist'
  
  require 'cougaar/scripting'
  require 'ultralog/scripting'
  
  ...
